This was made back in 2005 or so, with the intention of playing around with the mechanics of [Tlachtli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_ballgame),
before we implemented more of it in [Mahatta](https://github.com/ddionisio/Mahatta).

It followed after one of the UI editor versions, so the code will be roughly similar.

Also, for no real reason, probably just because I had OpenGL up and running, there is code to fill voxels with a sphere.
